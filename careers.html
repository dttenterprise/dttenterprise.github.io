  <h2>Career Comparisons</h2>
  <p>In our group we have three people who have chosen a form of software developer to be their ideal jobs, a software engineer, a cloud architect and an analyst specializing in cloud security. In comparison for the majority of our chosen jobs strong programming skills are essential for success, along with strong problem solving and communication skills. The most notable differences between our ideal jobs is between the jobs focused on software and the cloud focused jobs.<br> Where software developers/ engineers deal more with the day to day building and support of programs, a cloud architect and an analyst specializing in cloud security deal more with overseeing the big picture and dealing with issues as they arise and as such are less involved in day to day maintenance tasks.<br><br>
In comparing our groups career paths most of us will follow a similar path of a few years of experience with learning and using numerous programming languages, along with developing our analytical skills and gaining firsthand experience in how to develop/ engineer and maintain different software’s. These few years will be essential in building strong skills to build on to eventual achieve our ideal jobs  In contrast where our career plans will branch out is after these core skill building years where each person moves into a role that requires specific knowledge bases, like moving into dealing exclusively with the cloud or game development/ design. Once these specific skill sets are learned each of our career paths will branch off on their own, even within software development as each person’s chosen job is for a different area within software developing. Although our groups career plans will end in different spots for each group member, the core skills we build in the first few years will remain the same.
