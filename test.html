      <p>The Logician - INTP<br><br>People with INTP preferences tend to think strategically and are likely to build conceptual models to understand complex problems. They typically adopt a detached and concise way of analysing the world and often uncover new or innovative approaches.</p>

      <p>
        Tactile Learner - If you are a tactile learner, you learn by touching and doing. You understand and remember things through physical movement. You are a "hands-on" learner who prefers to touch, move, build, or draw what you learn, and you tend to learn better when some type of physical activity is involved. You need to be active and take frequent breaks, you often speak with your hands and with gestures, and you may have difficulty sitting still.

    <div class="testbox"><h2>Psychometric Test</h2>
      <p>The innovator is often the creative generator of a team. He or she has a strong imagination and a desire to be original. The innovator prefers to be independent and tends to approach tasks in a scientific way. As a creative individual the innovator may play a crucial role in the way a team approaches tasks and solves problems.</p>

        The Logician - INTP-T<br><br>
        The results of this test of this results suggest that I am introverted, Intuitive, Thinking and Perceptive. I feel this is relatively accurate, the only change I could see is that I am more ‘observant’ or ‘sensing’ in that I prefer to be grounded in reality than to be thinking large and whimsical. The Identity of being ‘Turbulent’ is definitely correct as I am never truly confident about my own abilities or actions.</p>

      <p>
        The Vark test determined that my learning preference is Multimodal, that I adapt and have no real difference in learning style. It also scores me higher on Visual and Kinesthetic learning, which I feel is accurate. I generally enjoy a visual medium of recorded and editing videos over other types and I feel I learn best when something is demonstrated through action.
      </p>

    <div class="testbox"><h2>Psychometric Test</h2>
      <p>The third test presented shows that I am most suited towards the role of the Analyst, someone who is reserved and critical, I feel this is accurate as I am less extroverted and prefer to think things over for considerable amounts of time before reaching a decision. This also shows that I am less likely to be a driver or someone who is very ambitious and energetic, or the ‘chairperson’ who is most likely to coordinates the team and brings them together. </p>

      <p> The Architect - INTJ<br><br>
        Quick, Imaginative and Strategic<br>
        High Self-Confidence<br>

        Logical 16/20<br>
        Visual 15/20<br>
        Solitary 14/20<br><br>
        What this result tells me is that my preferred learning styles are reasoning and a systems approach using pictures, images and spatial understanding. I also prefer to self-study and work alone.
        Results from the tests indicate that the way I do not learn is with speech, writing or sounds.
        To make this simpler I learn by doing or physically seeing a task done.

        Self-Management 7/10<br>
        Social Awareness 5/10<br>
        Relationship Management 3/10<br><br>
        What these results tell me is that my ability to work within a team or group is at a high level as long as the group has a common goal. As you can see with this result, I am more of a task and results focused individual and my relationships and interaction with others run second priority for me.

    <div class="Analysis"><h2>Test Analysis</h2>
      <p>Between our 6 group members we have a member from each of the 4 role categories defined by
      Myer-Briggs; Analysts, Diplomats, Sentinels and Explorers. This combination of varying skills gives us
      a good foundation of personal strengths to bring to teamwork, while at the same time using these
      strengths to offset our team members weaknesses. For example, one of Logicians weaknesses is a
      tendency to second-guess themselves, while Architects possess the strength on high self-confidence,
      when combined in a team environment these traits can balance themselves out and help to create a
      fully functional team. The same goes for Advocates weakness to burn out easily and Virtuosos
      strength of prioritization.<br><br>
      Our Team's learning styles are varied with a small lean towards visual learners, this is
      really beneficial in our team because it makes us adaptable to multiple different forms of media.
      However it can also become a potential issue with compatability when bringing workflows together.
      This analysis should make us aim to delegate work in regards to peoples preferred style to make
      the most of thier abilities.
      <br><br>
      Our Psychometric tests are a blend of everything, we have Lars as an Innovator, who likes to do his own
      thing and experiment. James is an Analyst who is critical and has the potential to overthink.
      Joshua's test was in abstract reasoning which presents him as someone who can learn quickly and apply
      new information to problems.  Matt is best in a team which shares common goals and is task oriented.
      Ashtons personality test presents him as someone who considerate and open to change, while being less confident
      in his own abilities. Radib...<br><br>
      Similar to our learning styles we have a mixture of different people, the biggest issue is making sure that
      we can delegate tasks without causing too many issues with how people prefer to work.
