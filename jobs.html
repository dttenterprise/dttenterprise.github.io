      Lars
    </h2>
    <p>
    <b>Software Engineer</b><br><br>
    This Job is appealing to me for many reasons. The role is with a well-known company that is built off software. Working with them would be an amazing opportunity and a great company to learn and grow. Skills required for this role would be years of experience in C++ and other coding languages. Experience coding across different platforms and understanding issues that arise.
    At this moment this job is not a role that I would be able to acquire. My skills are basics in Java and building computers.<br><br>
    My plan to gain this kind of role would be to finish my studies and gain an entry level position being a junior software developer for a smaller company that I can learn and grow to gain the experience and skills needed to succeed. Learning C++, Python and java is a first step. Learning to turn code into a game either using unity or another program would be a great reference to develop my skills.

    <p>
      <b>Snr Software Developer</b><br><br>
      My ideal job would be meshing I.T with something that I love from outside of it. That’s why my ideal job would be a Software Developer for Wizards of the Coast. <br>

      This position is one where I would be working towards developing the game ‘Arena’ on multiple platforms and making decisions on designing the game as it develops through new sets. I would be working with teams of developers in a senior role to troubleshoot and analyze code. This job is appealing to me as it would be working to develop something which is a passion of mine. <br><br>

      This job requires a lot of experience in software development and specifically game development, coding in numerous languages and working with online services to deliver multi-platform experiences, it also requires a strong teamwork and independent oriented person, who can manage others but also make critical decisions with incomplete information.

      Josh

    <p>
      <b>Cloud Architect</b><br><br>
      A Cloud Architect is a specialist who is responsible for overseeing a company's cloud program. This includes cloud creation, cloud design, management and monitoring. Cloud architects basically oversee the creation and smooth running of a cloud system.<br>
      This position is appealing to me because of multiple factors, firstly the ability to lead a team on a sophisticated project, good pay and flexible hours.<br>
      The qualifications necessary for this position are way above my own, requiring knowledge of AWS cloud solutions, previous experience and a TOGAF certification.<br>
      The skills, experience and or qualifications that I currently hold in regards to this field are almost zero.
      From here, I will finish a bachelor of information technology and then continue into specialist study, and hopefully be able to secure an internship along the way.

      What makes this job interesting to me is the automation aspect.

      Minimum of 1 year hands-on technology or analytics experience in application development, data science/analytics, or advanced data management

      Job Analysis  </h2>
      <p>Within the group we have various different ideas on what is an ideal job. One of the group members Matt has focused on not finding the 'Ideal Job' and has chosen something to provide him skills and experience to get a idea of whats out there. Some of our group members have more specific positions they want to obtain for various reasons, such as James and Radib who have chosen fields wherer they think thier passion lies.<br>
      One of our team, Josh has chosen a Cloud Architect because it would be challenging and would allow him to lead a team.<br><br>
      For titles, 3 of the team have basically the same title at various degress of seniority (James,Matt & Ashton) whilst Lars has a similar focus on software, with the two outliers being Josh and Radib focusing on Cloud infrastructure and Security repectively.
      I think the common thread between the group is that most of us don't have a precise 'ideal job' but want to work with a specific section of the I.T field. All of us are basically novices in the world of I.T so we don't really know what is out there to accomplish.
