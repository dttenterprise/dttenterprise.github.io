      <h3> Lars </h3>
        <p>
          I have been working in hospitality since I was in school. I have always had a passion for IT but have never pursued a career where I could utilize skills. I graduated 2011 from high school and do not have any further qualifications.  My IT related experience is based around hardware mainly, I like to build computers and set them up, I have helped friends and family with any technology based issues. <br><br>
          Hobbies of mine include gaming, movies. I have a strong passion for wine and fine dining and would rather try and make something for myself then buy it.

        <h3> James </h3>
          <p>
            Up to now, I have worked in mostly retail work. I started as a checkout operator and transitioned into management after a couple of years. My interest in I.T stems from a fascination with gadgetry and video games mostly. I've always been interested in how all of this works together. My experience in I.T is essentially just building computers and working with Visual Basic when I was a teenager. <br><br>
            My hobbies include reading about history, Magic the Gathering and listening to music.

        <h3> Ashton </h3>
          <p>
          My hobbies mainly revolve around camping and cooking, but when I have time I also like to play video games like Skyrim and Battlefield.<br><br>
          My background was originally hospitality and I have moved into customer service/ support, but am looking to use the skills I have doing a degree in IT to move from the user focused area of the company I work for to the more software focused area.
